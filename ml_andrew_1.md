What is machine learning? 
-- a computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if it's performance at task T, as measured by P and improves with experience E. 

From my understanding, it is we try to improve the computer's performance on a certain task, and at the same time, measure the performance of the task. 


Gradient Descent:
Gradient descent uses calculus as the calculating method to obtain the minimum change of m and b(in y = mx + b)
minimum change of m = error * m 
minimum change of b = error
