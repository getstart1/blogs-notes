Today I review the Openwords lesson builder website for several reasons. First, I think that this is a good opportunity for me to refresh my memory about JQuery and JavaScript. Second, I want to reorganize my thoughts about this project.

Today, I continue trying about connecting local server with XAMPP's database. 

What is XAMPPï¼š it is a open source cross-platform web server solution stack package developed by Apache Friends. It consists Apache HTTP server, MySQL database...

In order to write a PHP file and run on the local server, we need to follow the following steps:
1) run XAMPP, start the local server and all the services(Mysql, proFTPD, Apache)  -- this is for opening the services
2) write a PHP file -- PHP file includes the code for connect to the database that associates with the server. 
3) Put the PHP into this folder belongs to XAMPP: ~/htdocs
	After entering this folder, I can create a new folder. Put php file into this new folder, easier to manage the file later. 
	
My failure was because I put the file into a different XAMPP folder, but not the one that associates with the server. For mac, it is under the Shared category, and there is an IP address. Click this IP address, then I will be able to find the target 'htdocs' folder. 


After figuring out how to open a php web page in a server, next step is to actually connect to the database. 

The code I used to connect to connect to the database is as the following: 
```PHP
$servername = "localhost";
$username= "root";
$password= "";
$conn= new mysqli($servername,$username,$password);

//check connection
if($conn -> connect_error){
    die("Connection failed: ". $conn->connect_error);
}
else{
    echo"Server connected successfully";
}
```

The code I used to create a new database is as the following:
```PHP
$sql= "CREATE DATABASE newDB1";
if ($conn-> query($sql) == TRUE){
    echo"Database created successfully";
}else {
    echo"Error creating database". $conn->error;
}
```

The tutorial I followed that works is:
