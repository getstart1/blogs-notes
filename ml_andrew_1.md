What is machine learning? 
-- a computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if it's performance at task T, as measured by P and improves with experience E. 

From my understanding, it is we try to improve the computer's performance on a certain task, and at the same time, measure the performance of the task. 


Gradient Descent:
Gradient descent uses calculus as the calculating method to obtain the minimum change of m and b(in y = mx + b)
minimum change of m = error * m 
minimum change of b = error

Learning rate decides if the gradient descent converges and when to converge.

Now I understand that there should be 

I want to learn by real life practice. The first thing I want to try is linear regression and gradient descent. I chose a dataset from the following Kaggle website: https://www.kaggle.com/rsadiq/salary/version/1
