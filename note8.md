Wireshark

Experiment with Wireshark:

Experiment procedure: 
	1) Close all the browsers
	2) Open the application
	
My question is how to check the application that associates with a certain IP address. 



sudo lsof -i:port-number 
219.96.67.38

216.58.196.133



qq ip: 13.236.72.135
my ip: 10.101.1.25
203.205.218.36


192.168.1.74
